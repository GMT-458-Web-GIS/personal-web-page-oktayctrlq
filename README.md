📘 Project Title

Personal Web Page Project

This project was developed as part of the GMT458 Web GIS course to create a personal web page using modern web technologies.

🎯 Objective

The purpose of this project is to design and build a personal portfolio-style website using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and OpenLayers.
The website demonstrates both aesthetic design and basic GIS interactivity.

🧩 Project Structure

The project consists of three main pages:

Page	Description
index.html	Home page – includes a typing (typewriter) text animation, fade-in transition, and an interactive OpenLayers map.
background.html	“About Me” page – features a personal info card with profile photo and gradient animated background.
social.html	Social media page – displays glowing social media cards and a section listing hobbies and interests.
💡 Technologies Used
Technology	Purpose
HTML5	To structure the website content
CSS3	For layout design, animations, transitions, and visual effects
JavaScript (Vanilla)	For the typing animation, page fade effects, and OpenLayers map logic
OpenLayers (OL)	For adding and customizing the interactive web map
GitHub Pages	For version control and web deployment
🗺️ OpenLayers Component

The map is centered on Ankara, Turkey, using both OpenStreetMap and Stamen Watercolor layers.

A custom marker highlights Hacettepe University.

Clicking the map displays the coordinates in the console.

Zoom, scale, and fullscreen controls are active.

🎨 Design Features

Animated black-to-navy gradient background

Typewriter (typing) effect on homepage text

Smooth fade-in/out transitions between pages

Glowing card effects for social links

Gradient glowing text headings

Fully responsive and visually consistent theme

🤖 AI Assistance

Some portions of this project (e.g., animations, map code, and styling) were developed with the help of ChatGPT (AI tool).
Learned and applied concepts:

Typewriter text animation in JavaScript

OpenLayers map integration

Page fade transitions

Gradient text and glowing CSS effects

Approximate AI support time: ~2.5 hours

🗂️ Git & Workflow

Work was completed over three consecutive days, with commits representing progress:

Day 1: Base HTML and CSS structure

Day 2: OpenLayers map integration

Day 3: Animations, transitions, and final polishing
